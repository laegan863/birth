                            A Vital Record is a government-issued document in the United States that verifies a significant life event. There are four main types: birth, death, marriage, and divorce certificates.

                        <p class="fw-semibold text-light-grey">
                            U.S. citizens have the legal right to request any of these certificates for themselves or, in specific circumstances, on behalf of someone else. These documents serve as official proof and can be accessed by making a formal request.

                        <p class="fw-semibold text-light-grey">
                            These certificates, or records, contain key details about the related event, such as names, dates, and places. Depending on your needs, they can be used for various purposes, like proving identity, applying for benefits, or resolving legal matters.

                        <p class="fw-semibold text-white">
                            There are various times when a U.S. citizen needs to show a vital record to confirm an important life event. These records are often required when you apply for a passport, get a driver's license, register a child in school, or for employment purposes.
                            <br><br>
                            Even when it's not strictly required, having a vital record can be helpful for certain applications, like those for credit cards or other memberships. It can make the process smoother and quicker.
                            <br><br>
                            Many people also apply for these certificates when they're researching their family history or genealogy. Having these records can be invaluable for tracking down family roots and building a detailed family tree.
